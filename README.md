# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This will be my Rock, paper or scissors project where I will be creating a game where the player plays rock, paper or scissors against the computer. My goal is that the computer will select randomly between the 3 options and compare it to the players choice. It will also feature a counter where the best of 5 will win. This will be my first real project.
